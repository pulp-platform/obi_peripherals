# OBI Peripherals

This repository contains a collection of peripheral IPs using the Open Bus Interface (OBI), which can be used together with our OBI [interconnect IPs](https://github.com/pulp-platform/obi).

These peripherals were developed as part of the PULP project, a joint effort between ETH Zurich and the University of Bologna.
